# Automated Offset Detection in Global Positioning System Time Series Using Sliding-Window based Machine and Deep Learning Methods
As a Simons Summer Research Scholar, I was fortunate to work under Dr. William Holt who studies the deformation of the Earthâ€™s crust using GPS data within the Department of Geosciences at Stony Brook University. I architected an autonomous system for offset (small shifts in time-series data caused by maintenance or seismic activity) detection in continuous GPS (cGPS) data using a novel sliding window algorithm. The system was inspired by sliding-window algorithms for object detection, and I used sktime along with TensorFlow for most of the machine learning I tested numberous ML models and tuned hyperparameters, achieving a final F1 score of .98/1 on both classes. The poster for this project was presented at the Simons Research Symposium. The research was then further extended and presented at the Virginia State Science Fair, where I won 3rd prize in my category. Special thanks to Mradula Vashishtha, Jeonghyeop Kim, William Holt for their guidance in this project.
